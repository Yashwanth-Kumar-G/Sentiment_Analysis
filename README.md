# Sentiment_Analysis

Sentiment analysis is the process of analyzing digital text to determine if the emotional tone of the message is positive, negative, or neutral. Today, companies have large volumes of text data like emails, customer support chat transcripts, social media comments, and reviews. Sentiment analysis tools can scan this text to automatically determine the authorâ€™s attitude towards a topic. Companies use the insights from sentiment analysis to improve customer service and increase brand reputation.
